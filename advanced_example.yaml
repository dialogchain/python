# Advanced Example with Multiple Routes
routes:
  # Route 1: Simple timer with transform
  - name: "greeting_route"
    from: "timer:10s"  # Run every 10 seconds
    
    processors:
      - type: "transform"
        template: "Greeting from DialogChain at {{now().isoformat() if 'now' in globals() else 'current_time'}}!"
    
    to: "log:info"

  # Route 2: Message transformation
  - name: "transform_route"
    from: "timer:15s"  # Run every 15 seconds
    
    processors:
      - type: "transform"
        template: |
          {
            "message": "This is a test message",
            "status": "success",
            "count": 1
          }
      
      - type: "transform"
        template: "Processed message: {{message}} (Status: {{status}}, Count: {{count}})"
    
    to: "log:info"

  # Route 3: Conditional logging
  - name: "conditional_route"
    from: "timer:20s"  # Run every 20 seconds
    
    processors:
      - type: "transform"
        template: "test_status=failed coverage=75"
      
      # This filter will only pass through if condition is true
      - type: "filter"
        condition: "{{test_status}} == 'failed' or {{coverage}} < 80"
      
      - type: "transform"
        template: "ALERT: Test {{test_status}} with {{coverage}}% coverage (below threshold)"
    
    to: "log:warn"
